- readOp is a user defined type
- it is code of last action
- these codes are intergers, but we don't use iota to define constants
- declare them explicitly make it very clear
```go
// The readOp constants describe the last action performed on
// the buffer, so that UnreadRune and UnreadByte can check for
// invalid usage. opReadRuneX constants are chosen such that
// converted to int they correspond to the rune size that was read.
type readOp int8

// Don't use iota for these, as the values need to correspond with the
// names and comments, which is easier to see when being explicit.
const (
	opRead      readOp = -1 // Any other read operation.
	opInvalid   readOp = 0  // Non-read operation.
	opReadRune1 readOp = 1  // Read rune of size 1.
	opReadRune2 readOp = 2  // Read rune of size 2.
	opReadRune3 readOp = 3  // Read rune of size 3.
	opReadRune4 readOp = 4  // Read rune of size 4.
)
```
